# Daily Calories Calculator (C Program)

I’m excited to share my C programming project 👩‍💻✨  

This project helped me practice:
- Programming logic  
- Problem solving  
- Writing clean C code  

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple C console application for calculating:
- BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)
- TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
- Tracking daily calorie intake  

It also provides a recommendation based on calories consumed:
- Cutting  
- Maintain  
- Bulking  

---

## 📋 Features
- Calculates BMR based on:
  - Gender  
  - Weight  
  - Height  
  - Age  
- Computes TDEE depending on activity level.  
- Allows tracking of calorie intake from common foods.  
- Gives a recommendation (cutting, maintain, or bulking) based on calories consumed.

## 🧠 How to Run
1. Open the code in any C compiler (e.g., Programiz Online Compiler).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Enter your:
   - Gender  
   - Age  
   - Weight  
   - Height  
   - Activity level  
4. Add food items and number of servings.
5. The program will display:
   - BMR  
   - TDEE  
   - Final recommendation

## 🍎 Food Items Menu

| Option | Food Item    | Calories |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1      | Apple       | 95       |
| 2      | Sandwich    | 350      |
| 3      | Soda        | 150      |
| 4      | Banana      | 105      |
| 5      | Pizza Slice | 285      |

## 🛠️ How It Works
The program uses functions to organize logic:

- calculateBMR  
  > Computes basal calorie needs.  

- calculateTDEE  
  > Adjusts calories based on activity level.  

- calorieTracking  
  > Allows adding and calculating total calories consumed.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language  
- Console-based application  

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Improved problem-solving skills  
- Better understanding of functions in C  
- Experience with user input and calculations
